# About Me

<img src="/images/yangyang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="250">
My name is Yang Yang.  I am an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I am interested in developing machine learning-based algorithms and software for biological data analysis and biomedical information processing. 

## Research Interests

- Biomedical Image Understanding

We design machine learning algorithms for the annotation, clustering and segmentation of biomedical images, including spatial gene expression images, cryo-EM single-particle images, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopic images, etc.  


- Biological Language Modeling

We regard biological sequences (DNA/RNA sequences and amino acid sequences) as a special kind of language, and explore biomolecular structure and functions based on sequence analysis using statistical language models, word embeddings and deep learning models.   


- Machine Learning and Data Mining

We develop algorithms to deal with large scale, imbalanced and multi-label classification problems, mainly from the biomedical field.
